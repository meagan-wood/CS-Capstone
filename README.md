# Computer Science Capstone
## Project requirements for this section of the Capstone

Design and develop a fully functional data product (application) addressing your identified  business problem or organizational need. Your ability to explain how your application meets  said need is essential so remember it’s the overall context that your application is providing. To  the best of your ability, include each of the following attributes: 
Data Methods – provide one descriptive method that discerns relationships and  characteristics of the past data in at least three forms of visualization. Also, provide one nondescriptive where a decision or trend could be inferred. The descriptive method  should be in the domains of cluster or association analysis, and the others could include pruning algorithm, discriminate analysis, regression analysis (linear, logistic), Bayesian methods, neural networks, or support vector machines. Be sure to include a justification  of the methods selected in relationship to the goal(s) of the project. 

Examples of acceptable descriptive methods: 
• K-means clustering 
• Hierarchical clustering 
• Other clustering methods (max distance, min distance, etc.) 
• PCA (all variables need to be numeric) 
• MCA (all variables need to be factorized) 
• FAMD 
• Logistic regression with interpretations of estimated coefficients Multi-linear regression with interpretations of estimated coefficients 

Examples of appropriate non-descriptive methods: 
• Logistic regression 
• Decision trees 
• Random forest 
• Neural network 
• Multi-linear regression (if it includes a strong justification – like ease of  interpretability) 

Datasets – The use of dataset(s) is a critical element and involves the gathering and  measuring of information on targeted variables in a systematic fashion. This could be student-collected (Please consider IRB ramifications.) or publicly accessible such as websites (e.g. Kaggle.com), governmental (e.g. Department of Labor), or software related (e.g. GitHub.com). Be sure to consider the methodology used including possible disadvantages and challenges. 

Analytics – Using the given data, your application needs to enable decisions to be formulated or support for given trends to be provided.  

Data Cleaning – if applicable, create a function that will make the data usable prior to actually being used by the application—things such as featuring, parsing, cleaning, and wrangling the datasets. 

Data Visualization – You need at least three real-time (e.g. using the GUI/dashboard)  formats to visualize the data in a graphic format. Look at things like charting, mapping, color theory, plots, diagrams, or other methods (tables must include heat mapping).  These, in conjunction with or as a part of your GUI, would enable users to explore or inspect the data characteristics. 

Real-Time Queries – As part of your GUI enable users to access and manipulate data in real-time including data maintenance. This does not deal with data “freshness” but with  the query response time being in seconds.  

Adaptive Element – if appropriate for the business need, provide the implementation of machine-learning methods and algorithms to enable the application to improve with  experience. Examples include learning associations, classification, statistical arbitrage,  prediction, extraction, and regression.  

Outcome Accuracy – provide functionalities that evaluate the accuracy of the information/outcomes given by the application. What are the parameters for valid output  data and how will those be checked by the application?
